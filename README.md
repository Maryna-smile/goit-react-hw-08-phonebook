## ðŸŒº About Me

I have recently finished my IT courses at GoIT Academy as a Front-End developer. Having completed courses, I have gained knowledge of HTML, CSS, GIT, SASS, JavaScript, React, Redux, Webpack, RestAPI, and currently developing my skills in TypeScript and Node.js. In addition to this, I have priceless experience with implementing both individual and team projects (I was a Scrum Master on one of the team projects). 

I look forward to working for a company whose mission I firmly believe in, such as your own. I look for jobs about which I am passionate because this allows me to be extremely productive and creative. Also, it is very important for me to have an opportunity to grow and progress within the company. And of course, to achieve a healthy work/life balance.
